You are working inside the existing "VocabMastery" web application.
Your task is to enhance the existing **Top Learners** leaderboard.
All data already exists in the database — do NOT create mock data.

Use the attached screenshot as a visual reference.

====================
OBJECTIVE
====================
- Show **Grade** and **Unit** as part of the leaderboard table itself
- Allow **multi-select filtering** (not single-select) for Grade and Unit
- Keep everything fully wired, functional, and performant

====================
REQUIRED CHANGES
====================

1️⃣ TABLE STRUCTURE UPDATE
Modify the Top Learners table to include:
- Columns in this order:
  - Rank
  - Student
  - Grade
  - Unit
  - Score

Each row must clearly display:
- The student's grade level
- The unit number associated with the score

The table must:
- Sort correctly by Score (descending) within the active filter set
- Recalculate Rank dynamically when filters change

2️⃣ MULTI-SELECT FILTERS (GRADE & UNIT)
Replace the current single-select dropdowns with:
- **Multi-select filters** for:
  - Grade
  - Unit
- Users must be able to:
  - Select multiple grades at once (e.g., Grade 5 + Grade 6)
  - Select multiple units at once
  - Use Grade-only, Unit-only, or combined filtering

Filter behavior:
- If no Grade is selected → include all grades
- If no Unit is selected → include all units
- Filters must work together using AND logic
- Filtering must update results instantly without page reload

3️⃣ DYNAMIC FILTER OPTIONS
- Grade and Unit filter options must:
  - Be fetched dynamically from the database
  - Reflect only existing data
- Unit options should:
  - Update automatically when Grade filters change
  - Never show invalid grade–unit combinations

4️⃣ UX & VISUAL REQUIREMENTS
- Filters should:
  - Be clearly labeled ("Grade", "Unit")
  - Show selected values as chips/tags or checkmarks
- Table should:
  - Show a friendly empty state if no results match the filters
  - Maintain existing design language and spacing

5️⃣ DATA & STATE INTEGRATION
- All filtering must:
  - Be handled via real query logic or in-memory filtering (depending on existing architecture)
  - Preserve performance for large datasets
- Do NOT break:
  - Existing leaderboard logic
  - Scoring calculations
  - User ranking consistency

====================
QUALITY BAR
====================
- No hard-coded values
- No UI-only changes without logic
- No console errors
- Fully tested filter combinations
- Clean, readable code aligned with existing patterns

====================
DELIVERABLE
====================
Implement the above changes directly in the codebase so that:
- Grade and Unit are visible in the table
- Multiple Grades and Units can be selected at the same time
- Leaderboard updates correctly and intuitively
