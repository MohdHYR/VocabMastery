Please let's modify the existing **Learn Page** only.
All features mentioned below already exist somewhere in the project unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Do NOT create mockups, placeholders, or disconnected UI — everything must be fully wired and functional.

====================
CONTEXT
====================
- The Learn Page currently displays a single vocabulary word with:
  - Main word
  - Pronunciation icon
  - Definition
  - Usage example
  - Synonyms / Antonyms
  - A "New Word" button at the bottom
- Dictation Test flow already exists
- Multiple Choice Test flow already exists
- Word navigation logic/data already exists

Use the attached sketch as a visual reference for layout intent.

====================
REQUIRED CHANGES
====================

1️⃣ WORD NAVIGATION ARROWS
- Add a **backward arrow** on the LEFT side of the learn card to navigate to the **previous word**
- Add a **forward arrow** on the RIGHT side of the learn card to navigate to the **next word**
- Arrows must:
  - Be clearly visible but visually subtle
  - Be keyboard-accessible
  - Disable automatically when there is no previous or next word
- Navigation must update the full Learn Page state (word, definition, examples, audio, etc.)

2️⃣ PRONUNCIATION BEHAVIOR CHANGE
- Disable hover-to-pronounce behavior **for the main word text only**
- Pronunciation must be triggered automatically when the word pops up for the fisst time and ONLY via the speaker button
- When the speaker button is clicked:
  - Play pronunciation **three times in sequence**:
    1. Normal speed
    2. Slow speed
    3. Normal speed again
- Ensure:
  - No overlapping audio
  - Button is temporarily disabled while audio is playing
  - Works consistently across words

3️⃣ MOVE & RENAME "NEW WORD" BUTTON
- Move the existing "New Word" button from the bottom of the page to the **top area** (near the word header)
- Rename the button label to:
  👉 **"Take the Test"**
- Style it to feel like a primary action (clean, friendly, inviting — not aggressive)
- Do NOT break its existing logic — repurpose it

4️⃣ TEST SELECTION FLOW
- When the user clicks **"Take the Test"**:
  - Show a clear choice UI with **two options**:
    1. **Dictation Test**
    2. **Multiple Choice**
- Both options must:
  - Reuse existing test components
  - Be visually distinct and easy to choose
- Modify the journey so:
  - The selected test starts using the **current word context**
  - After test completion, user can return to the Learn Page seamlessly

5️⃣ FULL INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS
- All changes must be:
  - Fully wired to existing state, routes, or stores
  - Tested for navigation, audio, and test flow
  - Free of console errors
- Maintain existing design language and responsiveness
- Do not remove or regress any current functionality

====================
DELIVERABLE
====================
- Implement the above changes directly in the codebase
- Update only what is necessary
- Ensure everything works end-to-end without manual refreshes
