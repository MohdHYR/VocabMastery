Please modify existing features only — do NOT create mock data, placeholders, or disconnected UI.
All logic must be fully wired to the real database, state, and routing.

====================
SCOPE
====================
Modify the following areas:
- Top Learners Board
- Dictation Test flow
- Choose a Test screen
- Choose Your Lesson screen

====================
REQUIRED CHANGES
====================

1️⃣ TOP LEARNERS BOARD — SCORE BY GRADE & UNIT
- Modify the "Top Learners" board to:
  - Display learner scores **per Grade Level** and **per Unit Number**
  - Allow sorting and filtering the leaderboard by:
    - Grade level
    - Unit number
- Filters must:
  - Be dropdown-based
  - Be populated dynamically from the database
  - Update the leaderboard instantly without page reload
- The leaderboard should clearly reflect:
  - Selected grade(s)
  - Selected unit(s)
  - Correct ranking based on score within that scope
- Maintain current design language and performance

2️⃣ DICTATION TEST COMPLETION FLOW
- After a user finishes the **Dictation Test**:
  - Do NOT automatically start the Multiple Choice test
  - Instead, redirect the user back to the **"Choose a Test"** screen
- Preserve:
  - Current lesson context (grade, unit, word set)
  - User progress state

3️⃣ EXPAND "CHOOSE A TEST" OPTIONS
- Modify the "Choose a Test" screen to include **four options**:
  1. Dictation Test
  2. Multiple Choice Test
  3. Go to Learn
  4. Go to Home
- All options must:
  - Be clearly distinguishable
  - Be fully functional
  - Use existing routes/components
- Navigation must be seamless and state-aware (no resets unless intended)

4️⃣ DYNAMIC DROPDOWNS IN "CHOOSE YOUR LESSON"
- In the "Choose Your Lesson" screen:
  - Replace any static inputs for:
    - Grade Level
    - Unit Number
  - With **dropdown lists**
- Dropdown values must:
  - Be fetched dynamically from the database
  - Reflect only available grades and units
  - Update the available Unit list when a Grade is selected
- Ensure:
  - No invalid grade/unit combinations can be selected
  - Clean UX with loading states if needed

====================
INTEGRATION & QUALITY
====================
- All changes must be:
  - Fully wired and functional
  - Integrated with existing state, database, and routing
  - Free of console errors
- Do NOT break or remove any existing features
- Follow current coding patterns and architecture
- Ensure responsiveness and accessibility remain intact

====================
DELIVERABLE
====================
- Implement all changes directly in the codebase
- Test all flows end-to-end:
  - Leaderboard filtering
  - Dictation completion
  - Test selection navigation
  - Lesson selection logic
